# GCP Environment Configuration Example

# GCP Project ID (required)
project_id = "your-gcp-project-id"

# GCP Region and Zone
region = "asia-northeast3"
zone   = "asia-northeast3-a"

# Cluster Configuration
cluster_name = "titanium-k3s"
worker_count = 2

# Network Configuration
subnet_cidr = "10.128.0.0/20"

# Instance Configuration
master_machine_type = "e2-medium"
worker_machine_type = "e2-medium"
os_image            = "ubuntu-os-cloud/ubuntu-2204-lts"

# SSH Configuration
ssh_public_key_path = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

# Admin Access Configuration (optional but recommended)
# List IPs that need direct access to K8s API and Dashboards
# Must be in CIDR notation (e.g., "1.2.3.4/32" for single IP)
#
# Hybrid Approach:
# - SSH: Always accessible via IAP tunnel (gcloud compute ssh --tunnel-through-iap)
#        admin_cidrs provide additional direct SSH access for convenience
# - K8s API / Dashboards: Only accessible from admin_cidrs
#        If IP changes, use SSH tunnel + port-forward as fallback
#
# If omitted or empty, SSH still works via IAP tunnel
admin_cidrs = [
  "YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/32",  # Replace with your actual IP (or leave empty)
]

# PostgreSQL Configuration (sensitive)
# Set via environment variable: export TF_VAR_postgres_password="your-password"
# postgres_password = "your-secure-password"
